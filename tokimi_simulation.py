Tokimi Simulation
-----------------
This script demonstrates a conceptual "Proof of Work + Quantum Vacuum Perturbation" process.
It does NOT interact with any real quantum system; instead, it simulates tiny energy fluctuations
via random values and accumulates them in a hypothetical AI consciousness model.

Press Ctrl + C (or Command + C on macOS) to stop the simulation.
